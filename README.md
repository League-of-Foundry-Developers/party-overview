# party-overview

SCREENSHOT/GIF/VIDEO GOES HERE

A quick overview about the players that have tokens placed on the currently active scene. At a glance, you will see

- Current and maximum hitpoints
- Armor Class
- Passives: Perception, Investigation and Insight
- On a second tab: All languages your players might know and which one of them can speak said language

Using filters, you can hide and show players to your hearts desire, to quickly get the information you need in the heat of the battle.

### Caveats and additional information

- Only tokens that are owned by players will appear in the list: Assign those permissions by right-clicking on the Actor in the sidebar, then select "Permissions" and set "Owner"-role to one of the configured players
- When switching scenes, the list will automatically update to show only the currently active players

## Configuration

You can set three options for this module, which define who can use the two parts of this module: The overview window and the tooltips.

- You can grant players access to the overview window

## Other module suggestions

- The [Token Tooltip Alt](https://github.com/bmarian/token-tooltip-alt) module enables all of the functionality removed from previous versions of party-overview, and more! We recommend enabling both modules for a full-featured experience.
